# machine_learning_trading_bot

### Overview
I am assuming the role of a finanical advisor at one of the top five financial adviosry firms in the world. My goal is to improve  the existing algorithmic trading systems to maintain the firm's competitive advantage in the market. By enhancing thr existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

### Answer this question
Report that compares the performance of the machine learning models based on the trading predictions that each makes and the resulting cumulative strategy returns.

### Answer this question
Write your conclusions about the performance of the baseline trading algorithm in the README.md file thatâ€™s associated with your GitHub repository. Support your findings by using the PNG image that you saved in the previous step.

### Answer this question
Tune the training algorithm by adjusting the size of the training dataset. To do so, slice your data into different periods. Rerun the notebook with the updated parameters, and record the results in your README.md file. Answer the following question: What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the training window?

Tune the trading algorithm by adjusting the SMA input features. Adjust one or both of the windows for the algorithm. Rerun the notebook with the updated parameters, and record the results in your README.md file. Answer the following question: What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing either or both of the SMA windows?

Choose the set of parameters that best improved the trading algorithm returns. Save a PNG image of the cumulative product of the actual returns vs. the strategy returns, and document your conclusion in your README.md file.

### Create an Evaluation Report

In the previous sections, you updated your README.md file with your conclusions. To finish this section, add a summary evaluation report at the end of the README.md file. For this report, express your final conclusions and analysis. Support your findings by using the PNG images that you created.
